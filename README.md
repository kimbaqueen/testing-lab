# testing-lab

<!-- Step 1 
2 high level (broad) tests
high level - tested fields entry on enter wanted. 
Optional fields are erroring out as required but they are optional and also do not have the blue required fields.

2 low level (specific) tests

1 smoke/sanity test (basic run through of the whole site)
cancel wanted screen does not correctly accept fields when all entered. Still get error that one optional field is required when there is no optional field available. All 3 are required.
